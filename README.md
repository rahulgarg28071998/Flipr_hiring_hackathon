# Flipr_hiring_hackathon
OBJECTIVE
-> The goal is to get real-time forecasts and other critical information to front-line health-care workers and public policy makers as the outbreak unfolds. 
-> The objective of the Hackathon is to predict the probability of person getting infected by Covid-19. 

BRN
-> The basic reproduction number (BRN) is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case. 
-> A BRN greater than one indicates that the outbreak is self-sustaining, 
    while a BRN less than one indicates that the number of new cases decreases over time and eventually the outbreak will stop. 
->  PHASE I   - 3.1
    PHASE II  - 2.6
    PHASE III - 1.9
    PHASE IV  - 0.9 (or) 0.5
-> The BRN of SARS decreased from 2.7 to 0.25 after the patients were isolated and the infection started being controlled.
